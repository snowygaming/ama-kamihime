            <p style="font-size: 14px;">
                Modern day gaming communities all, for more or less, have one or more community discord servers serving as a chat platform to host discussions, exchange ideas, as well as interact in both text and voice with others that share similar interest for that particular game. 
                <br><br>
                These community discord servers are often created by 1 individual, the owner, who delegates control to other individuals, the admins, to act as the governing body of the server.  This sounds straight forward and reasonable until this small group of individuals that have power start to prioritizing personal interest, or group's interest, over the interest of the community as a whole.  This is further more apparent when the governing body is consisted of familiar friends who have common interest or team mates from the same in-game community.
                <br><br>
                There has always been a desire to come up with a checks-and-balances approach to these community owned chatting platforms.  What we propose below are series of designs or principles to creating and sustaining a fair and regulated gaming community discord server.

            <p style="font-size: 14px;">
                Who should have power and who should not is a highly debatable topic.  To prevent the centralization of power within a small number of people, there needs to be multiple governing bodies that have similar rights, or say, on important matters.  Major changes and decisions are decided using voting systems, such as popular vote or two-thirds majority vote.

                <h4 style="margin: 0 0 5px;">Union Leaders</h4>
                These are the leaders of in-game communities.  Individuals can request to be given the Union Leader role as long as the individual can provide proof that his/her union satisfies a certain requirement threshold.  This can be, for example, getting N million as a union in a union raid.  The key here is that this role should be granted without bias, and to all that satisfies the requirement. The requirements are to be publically stated in a clear manner and should only be altered by voting process. 
                <br><br>
                <h4 style="margin: 0 0 5px;">Community Leaders</h4>
                These are the influential members of the community.  There is really no clear-cut qualification for this role.  One possible approach is for an individual be sponsored in by members of the existing governing body, then be approved by majority vote.
                <br><br>
                <h4 style="margin: 0 0 5px;">Discord Contributors</h4>
                These are the people who maintains the discord server, the worker bees that keep the discord running.  Discord owner and admins belong to this role.  There can also be other members that belong to this role that are responsible for updating the news, or contribute content.
                <br><br>
                <h4 style="margin: 0 0 5px;">Official Representatives</h4>
                These are the established bodies of influential entities of the game.  They can be official community managers, representatives of Wikipedia page, etc.  These folks may not be involved in the daily activities of the discord server, thus they should serve as advisers and can be exempt from the voting processes.
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                To prevent imbalance of power within each role, there should only be a max of N number of individuals that belong to the same in-game community.  N is to be decided by the community, we suggest a max of 3 as default.
                <br><br>
                When an individual is found to break rule of conduct, both in game and in discord, in bad faith.  A voting process is to be initiated for all governing bodies to decide on the course of action, including role removal if neccesary.<br><br>
