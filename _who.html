        <p> Amaterasu has been around for almost a year now. Beginning first as a love child of two separate guilds; Koori no Okami and Neverland.  Koori no Okami; a guild known for its complicated name and love of Abscess hard mode.  Neverland; a small guild of mostly EU gamers. Responsible for Surgeon first Archer, who later wisened up and changed class.  It's then at the time during Tera's patch the "Wounded World," that we found each other. Sheltering more than a dozen Surgeon's and Determined. Setting our eyes on the new Shiny title and Vision Maker gear that awaits us around the corner.  We began as a guild. We became a guild of friends. Now inseparable, we tackle endgame content together and continue to recruit new friends along the way...though the story doesn't end there.</p>
